#graph one: This graph shows median income vs CPP. CPP is scaled here. 
#graph two: The second graph shows median income affected by CPP. If the user wants CPP to affect the graph the y axis will be CPP Affected Median Income.
# Else the graph will just use Median income for the y axis.

#graph three: The third graph shows white peoples average income in comparison to a person of colors CPP.

# CPP uses the checkbox to change the numbers on the graph to be manipulated by the CPP.
