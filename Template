~ all races part line 6 create manual cloumn for race, and apply all races
~apply cpi purchasing power info with new date format by doing range low for year and high for year
~ 2 new columns in household income (one for low end and one for high end of CPI purchasing power), avg for summarization

Basic template for join:


inner_join_result <- inner_join(df1, df2, by = "key_column")


left_join_result <- left_join(df1, df2, by = "key_column")


right_join_result <- right_join(df1, df2, by = "key_column")


full_join_result <- full_join(df1, df2, by = "key_column")


How to filter data:

filtered_data <- filter(your_dataset, condition_column == filter_condition)



How to aggregate data:

# Aggregate data based on a grouping variable
grouped_data <- group_by(your_dataset, group_by_column)
aggregated_data <- summarize(
  grouped_data,
  total_count = n(),
  average_value = mean(numerical_column),
  max_value = max(numerical_column)
  # Add additional summary statistics as needed
)

adding new columns:

library(dplyr)

# If dataset is in a CSV file, you can read it using read.csv("your_file.csv")

# Create a new categorical variable
your_dataset$new_categorical_variable <- factor(ifelse(your_dataset$condition, "Category A", "Category B"))

# Create a new continuous/numerical variable
your_dataset$new_numerical_variable <- your_function_to_generate_numerical_values()

# Summarization data frame
summarization_table <- summarise(
  group_by(your_dataset, new_categorical_variable),
  total_count = n(),
  average_numeric = mean(new_numerical_variable),
  max_numeric = max(new_numerical_variable)
  # Add additional summary statistics as needed
)
